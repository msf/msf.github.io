# Miguel's tiny page

TODO:
- add link to professional resume
- mention specific systems that I worked on that I have a particular liking
- have a section about my tech-stack and personal tech setup
- publish some of my past talks in the form of posts:
  - what is innovation?
  - "view under the hood" of dynamoDB (from my personal memory)
  - design docs and how emotional or rational they are.
  - [How we improved DuneAPI using DuckDB](blogpost/blogpost-improving-dune-API.md)
- link to some toy repos of mine
- link to my "publications" (including the software patents while at DynamoDB) 

## About me

I’m Miguel Mascarenhas Filipe, and I like to solve problems so much that one of my mottos is *“problems are waiting to be solved”.* On twitter “Sui *generis, creative & adventurer. Loves distributed systems, hard problems, and First Principles Engineering”*

At Dune I’m the Tech Lead and Software Engineer on the API team.

My professional background has a ~6y stint on large scale distributed (and high throughput) systems at AWS/DynamoDB and Microsoft/Skype and ~12y on startup environments from 20 to 250 people.

## About this page

I've been thinking about having a simple page where I can put some thoughts or share something, either about technical tastes, preferences or whatnot. I use twitter to microblog (https://twitter.com/m3thos).

I kicked off this page with the contents of the "about me" internal page that we used in Dune (where I work).
Please note that this page is my *personal* site, with *my personal opinions*. 

## Communication Style

I’m what they say: What you see is what you get. I’m straight to the point, very candid and prefer a very down-to earth open communication, erring on the side of verbosity. :-)

I tend to think out loud during conversations to explain my reasoning further. I’m analytical and skeptical by nature, which at times might feel non-cooperative, but it’s simply my brain working out the problem.

## Working Style

- I’ve played team sports all my life and am a team-player through and through. It’s such a big part of my work style that I’m always trying to help and teamwork even when not explicitly asked.
- I like to think that I’m a first principles thinking person and always prefer to continuously iterate and improve on specific work practices and tech.
- I do welcome unplanned conversations or talks about a problem that recently arose (such as a production issue) or brainstorming  creative uses of a system/technology for a problem.
- I tend to follow a weekly flow for my work streams and I believe “planning helps us improvise better”, planning is essential but nothing is set in stone and we should learn and act based on new information as it arises.
- I’m not a morning person, before my two daughters I used to be night owl :-)
- Every time I find something that should be improved, either in tech or in workflows or procedures, I always try to clarify the problem and propose a solution in a productive way.

## Personality Style

If you like (or strongly believe) in personality tests, I’m a Meyers-Briggs ESTP.

According to wikipedia it maps to:

- Outgoing, Realistic, Action-Oriented, Curious, Versatile, Spontaneous, Pragmatic, Problem-Solver, Skillful Negotiator

I don’t know if I agree with the “skillful negotiator”, but I do fit the stereotype box quite well.

I believe everything in life is a combination of:

- hard-work, dedication
- knowledge & logic reasoning
- creativity (lateral thinking, questioning assumptions, questioning long-held practices/approaches)

## Feedback

Please provide feedback as early as possible! In whatever form works best for you. I usually find face-to-face conversations easier because we get additional information from non-verbal expressions and tone of voice.

You don’t need to use the sandwich of complement-feedback-complement, but fine if you use it. We’re all humans and we all like to hear positives once in a while.

Since we’re here, let me go ahead and share that one of my self-improvement never ending tasks is to be smoother and softer in the way in interact with others. I try hard to adjust my interaction styles to the audience. This is something that doesn’t come natural to me and I keep improving and working on it. Please provide any feedback you might have. :-)

## Stuff I like

- Sports
- Lists!
- Wilderness and Adventure
- I love animals and if I wasn’t an engineer I’d probably be a veterinarian.
- Food & Drinks, both eating and preparing meals.
- I’m a bit of a tree-hugger and follow renewable energies and Electric Vehicles avidly.

Odd fact, I don’t play computer games, never found them that entertaining. On my down-time I over-consume wikipedia, reddit, youtube, kindle & technical papers

On youtube my subscriptions are around:

- Civil engineering and urban planning
- animals (bbc wildlife & stuff)
- renewable energy related engineering stuff.
- Space & Rocketry
- Math
- Formula1

Books & Authors I heartily recommend:

- Zen and the Art of motorcycle maintenance (Robert Pirsig)
- Cryptonomicon (Neal Stephenson is one of my favorites)
- 1984, Brave New World (Orwell, Huxley)
- Asimov, Arthur C Clarke
- How to make friends and influence people (Dale Carnegie)
- Hitchhickers guide to the galaxy
- Mars Trilogy (Kim Stanley Robinson)
- Energy Transitions (Vaclav Smil)
